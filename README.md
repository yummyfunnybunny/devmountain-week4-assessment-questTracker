# Epic Adventure Game Quest Organizer

## - Description -

During my journey creating my dream video game, I have tried many different methods of organizing my data. I've tried notebooks, excel spreadsheets, and many online organizer apps. None of them have fully fit my needs to my liking. When designing a game at this scale, there are many interconnected pieces that are constantly changing as I do new iterations. Every organization method I've tried results in too many reduntant changeing and editing. I need a system that does all of the changing behind the scenes so I can make one change in one place and have everything else update on its own. This project is designed to fix this problem for me, so I can spend more time creating and less time updating notes and flowcharts.
